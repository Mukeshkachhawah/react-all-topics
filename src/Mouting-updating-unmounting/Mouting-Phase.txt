Mounting (when the component is created and added to the screen)

constructor():
Runs when the component is first created. It’s used to set up the initial state or bind event handlers.

constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
}

render():
Defines what the UI looks like. It returns the JSX that will be shown on the screen.

componentDidMount():
Runs after the component is added to the screen. It’s good for things like fetching data from a server.

componentDidMount() {
  console.log("Component is on the screen!");
}
